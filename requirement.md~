We have spelt out the functional and non-fuctional requirement our software will need to function.

Fuctional Requirements: With the assumption that we already have the data.
* Loads the data onto an array in the system.
* Generates a table for the available data.
* Generates a plot from the loaded data (pie-chart, bar, time-series).
* Further generates a brief statistical interpretation of the plot.

Non-Functional Requirements:
* Interacts with the central system of the hospitals to get information on the related disease within a specific time frame.


Use Case:
A user should be able to query to have a short forecast report depicting some statistics on the data.
